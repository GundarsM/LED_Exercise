# LED_Exercise
Test exercise for MikroTik:

Use STM32 or Atmel SAMD20 or Microchip PIC microcontroller to implement runngin light of atleast 9 LEDs and one button that can change the dirrection of lights. UART can be used for debugging and LED speed control
Language: C and/or C++
Compiler: any free of charge
Limitations: no libraries/SDK/HAL etc.
Use github/gitlab/bitbucket/sourceforge to save developement history

Used will be STM32F030R8T6 microcontroller that is a part of Nucleo-64 developement kit
  -this is the only microcontroller that is available to me at this time

For developement will be used Atollic TrueStudio for STM32 - https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/truestudio.html

STM32F030R8T6 reference manual - https://www.st.com/resource/en/reference_manual/dm00091010-stm32f030x4x6x8xc-and-stm32f070x6xb-advanced-armbased-32bit-mcus-stmicroelectronics.pdf
